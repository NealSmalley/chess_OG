#Terminal_InteliJ_Shortcut
How to create a terminal shortcut in intellijay?

Step 1: Check if the idea command already works

Type idea into the terminal
if it gives the error "zsh: command not found: idea" or another error that says it doesn't exist move to step 2.
Step 2: Find he Configuring Command-Line Launcher

open intelliJ idea
click on tools
click on "Create Command Line Launcher"
Step 3: Copy the path given into the terminal

Doing step 2 will lead to the following pop up below. Exa: To make the IDE accessible from the command line, please add 'random path information will be here' to the $PATH variable and use 'idea' to run commands.
Step 4: Add command to the terminal in this format

use the path that was in quotes and add some addtional information in the quotes and outside the quotes. export PATH="/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH"
If the error "export: not valid in this context: /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/MacOS:/Users/nealsmalley/miniconda3/bin:/Users/nealsmalley/miniconda3/condabin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/Users/nealsmalley/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.1/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin:/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/local/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/appleinternal/bin" appears that means you spelled something wrong.
Step 5: update the run commands without restarting the terminal:

run this command in the terminal: source ~/.zshrc
Step 6: open intelliJ with the terminal

type idea and the intelliJ should open up.
